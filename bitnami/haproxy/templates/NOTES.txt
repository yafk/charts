1. HAproxy has been started. You can find out the port numbers being used by HAProxy by running:

    $ kubectl describe svc {{ include "common.names.fullname" . }} --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }}

{{- if eq .Values.service.type "LoadBalancer" }}
2. Get HAProxy's load balancer IP/hostname:

    NOTE: It may take a few minutes for this to become available.

    You can watch the status by running:

        $ kubectl get svc {{ include "common.names.fullname" . }} --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }} -w

    Once 'EXTERNAL-IP' is no longer '<pending>':

        $ kubectl describe svc {{ include "common.names.fullname" . }} --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }} | grep Ingress | awk '{print $3}'

3. Configure DNS records corresponding to Kubernetes ingress resources to point to the load balancer IP/hostname found in step 3
